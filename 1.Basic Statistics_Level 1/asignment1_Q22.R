 # confidence interval is spread around the mean,
  #which means that we must deduct HALF the unwanted area off each side: 
   # Z scores for 90%  ==> (1-0.90)/2 ...confidence interval on right side
           p=     0.90+ 0.05
                qnorm(0.95)
 # for 94%  -->  (1-0.94)/2
           p=     0.94+0.03
                qnorm(0.97) 
 #for 60%  -->   (1-0.60)/2
           p=     0.60+0.2
                qnorm(0.8)
